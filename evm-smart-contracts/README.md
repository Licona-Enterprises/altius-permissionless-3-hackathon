# Project Name

A brief description of the project. Explain the purpose of the contract and how it's used in the project.

## Deployed Contract Addresses

This section contains the addresses where the contract is deployed on various blockchain networks.

## Contract ABI

Include a link or instructions for retrieving the contract ABI if applicable.

- **ABI**: [Contract ABI File](./path/to/your/ABI.json)

## Interacting with the Contract

You can interact with the contract on each network using any Ethereum-compatible wallet or Web3 provider. Popular methods include:

- **Etherscan/BscScan/PolygonScan:** You can use the networkâ€™s block explorer to interact directly with the contract using the contract's read/write interface.
- **Web3 Tools:** Use a Web3 library (e.g., ethers.js, web3.js) or dApp frontend to call contract functions.

## Usage

Describe how to use the contract or any dApp frontends that interact with it. You can include example code snippets or instructions for interacting with the contract on different networks.

```js
// Example for interacting with the contract using ethers.js
const contractAddress = "0xYourContractAddress";
const contractABI = [ /* ABI Array Here */ ];

const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider('networkName');
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, provider);
```
